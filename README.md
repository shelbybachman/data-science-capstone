This repository contains files for my capstone project for the Data Science Specialization from Johns Hopkins University on Coursera. In this project, I created a **word prediction app**: the app is trained on data from 3 large-text corpora in order to predict the next word based on a series of words inputted by the user.

*This report details how I cleaned training data from the text corpora.*

*This report details the app's accuracy in predicting the next word in a test set.*
